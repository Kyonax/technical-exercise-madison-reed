* OBJECTIVE
  The task simulates a real-world scenario involving image storage and retrieval within a web application. The goal is to demonstrate your ability to develop a functional user interface for viewing stored images.

* TIME ALLOCATION
  While a day is allotted, the expectation is to observe your progress and approach within a few hours rather than a fully polished, extended project. Focus on demonstrating your process efficiently.

* TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTs

- The application must fetch and display 100 images from the specified API endpoint: [[[https://picsum.photos/v2/list?limit=100][https://picsum.photos/v2/list?limit=100](https://picsum.photos/v2/list?limit=100][https://picsum.photos/v2/list?limit=100)]]. Using this exact API with the =limit=100= parameter is required (more documentation at [[[https://picsum.photos][picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos][picsum.photos)]]).
- Images should be presented in a gallery layout, organized as rows of thumbnails.
- Upon clicking an image, a modal should appear, displaying an enlarged version of the image along with its title and author information.
- Attention should be given to the application's styling, spacing, and typography.
- Aim for a harmonious and consistent user interface, but avoid spending excessive time on purely aesthetic refinements.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

# Example: fetch the list of 100 images

curl "[https://picsum.photos/v2/list?limit=100](https://picsum.photos/v2/list?limit=100)"
#+END_SRC

* SUBMISSION

- The completed code should be hosted in a GitHub repository. The repository can be public or private.
- If the repository is private, access must be granted to =@andris310=.
- The repository should include clear instructions on how to run the application on a local machine.

* NOTES

- Focus on clarity, component organization, and a working user experience over pixel-perfect design.
- Include any important assumptions or trade-offs in the repository README.
